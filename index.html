         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p> Hi I am Gabrielle, I am a recent college graduate starting my career in Web Development! Right now I am looking at HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I finished a 30-week Web Development course on Codecademy.com recently. While I continue my job search I am looking through the new Full Stack Web Development course on Codecademy offers a deeper dive into different frameworks like React. I am a second generation coder and am extremely proud of my accomplishment.</p> 
        <p> I am a big fan of Survivor, Game of Thrones, and Marvel movies. I also enjoy snowboarding, golfing, longboarding, painting, puzzles, and card games. I am the oldest child and have lived in Michigan almost my whole life. I love adventuring to Ann Arbor, Detroit and Grand Rapids, where I used to live. I really enjoy being around friends and family as I value them very much and they have made me the person I am today.</p>
